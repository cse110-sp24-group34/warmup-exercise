# Project Review and SWOT Analysis
<!-- Press Ctrl + Shift + V to view the Markdown file in VSCode -->
## Process Review
- **Planning Phase:** Our team consists of Sumukh, Mauricio, Ryan, Jeffery, Can. We decided to delegate based on what we felt we could maximise efficiency.
- **Development Phase:** 
  Building the basic calendar took the most time, with styling and additional features like our stylized font and logo completed towards the end.
- **Review Phase:** 
  We had made seperate branches to make sure that nothing would break, as well as put issues in the code review. We had left comments on the CSS and JavaScript to make sure that as more pieces were added, it was able to be maintained.
## To-do:
- [x] Implement the table
- [x] Keep track of current date, put into Calendar
- [X] Add the Touch Grass Logo!
- [X] Make the dates clickable!
- [x] Add a button that changes month (i.e, left and right)
- [x] Leap years... 
- [X] Implement some CSS and make it look pretty!
## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths
- **Team Collaboration:** 
  Strong team collaboration due to partner programming were evident, leading to exchanged ideas and more efficient debugging. 
 **Adaptability:**
 We were not too familar with HTML other than what was in the lab, but sharing online resources like tutorials and sharing advice or the bugs we were facing helped a lot. 

### Weaknesses
- **Uneven Skill Distribution:** 
  Not everybody had web development experience, which led to some having to do work asynchronously to catch up/watch tutorials.
- **Time Management:** 
  Towards the beginning was mostly planning and how to execute it, and towards the end we kicked it into high gear. Most of the practical work was towards the end of the calendar.
  <!-- Initial phases took longer than expected, putting pressure on later stages of the project timeline. -->

### Opportunities
- **Skill Development:**
  The calendar provided a great window into web development, allowing us to develop our skills in HTML and CSS greatly, that could benefit us in a workplace.
- **Process Improvement:** 
  I think we could pair up partners next time to program, maybe like partner programming. Maybe one from Sentiment team and one from Calendar team, but we could also work on our Agile framework and improve on it.
- **Timeline Improvemnts:** 
  Now that we know the capabilities of the members, we can better delegate responsibilities. If one member has more experience in JS for example, we can partner pair them up with someone who has no experience at all.

### Threats
- **Can lost his phone**
  Can got his phone robbed and was unable to be online for a few days while he got a replacement. He was unable to access Duo and was essentially locked out of all his information. 

## Summary of Learnings

- **Technical Skills:** 
  Learned a lot about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and version-based controls. Learned how to rollback a push as well as pulling and branching.
- **Team Dynamics:**
  We learned who was more efficient at writing clean code, as well who could write in Markdown the best. We had cleaned it up together with whoever we delegated to the task and realized that feedback is very important when there is a bug as well as comments that are descriptive.
- **Project Management:**
  The importance of an agile framework is not to be understated, it helped a lot in realizing our goals and realizations on what to do.
- **Personal Growth:**
  All of our skills with HTML and Git/GitHub certainly improved, as well as our team communication. It was rocky at first, but we soon realized what worked like telling the team immediately as soon as there was an issue.

## Conclusion
Creating the calendar not only helped us improve our communication skills, but it also improved our techinical skills by allowing to experiment with new CSS and HTML skills. It has taught us the importance of collaborative feedback, as well as our pain areas for improvement that we can better on next time.
